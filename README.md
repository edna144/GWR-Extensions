**GINGER (Growing and Incremental Networks based on GWR-Extensions for Recognition tasks)**

This repository contains 3 types of extensions of the Grow-When-Required (GWR) self-organizing neural network by Marsland et al. (2002)

Use **demo** files for off-the-shelf functionalities for self-organizing networks such as: create, train, test, save, import, and plot.

----------------------------------------------------------
**Associative GWR** (AGWR; Parisi et al., 2015) - Standard GWR extended with associative labelling for learning label histograms for each neuron.
----------------------------------------------------------
**GammaGWR** (Parisi et al., 2017) - GWR neurons are equipped with a number of context descriptors for temporal processing.
